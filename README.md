- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sebbe
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in full time development positions, I currently do some development in my current position but would like to make it full time. My strenghts in development lies in
different types of integrations/integration architechtures and API's. I also have a strong foundation in Vanilla Javascript that I use most of the times. Most of the integrations
I have created / own work related projects i have done is written in Python using Django framework.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on strengthening my react skills
-Disclaimer: My repo isn't unfortunately up to date since most of my projects are work related and can't be shared on public repository.
